# flask-blog-practice
This project is a simple blog application built using Flask. It renders blog posts from an external API, includes static pages (About, Contact), and allows users to send messages via a contact form that sends emails using SMTP. The blog uses a Bootstrap-based theme and separates logic cleanly into Flask views and HTML templates
